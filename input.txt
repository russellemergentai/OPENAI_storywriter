Thomas has captured nearly every moment of his daughter's life with either a small airborne drone who follows them everywhere or wearables. Inadvertently he has also captured himself allowing Thomas to create a replica father to accompany replica Elana in her virtual world.

### **Synopsis**

chapter 1: A day at the beach
In the quaint coastal town of Cannon Beach, Oregon, Thomas Evans and his daughter, Elara, enjoy a perfect day at the beach, their favorite getaway. Describe them building a sand castle, the gulls in the air, and the noises of the beach. Describe the sand in her hands as she crouches by the sand castle. Describe the ache in his heart as he worries he may lose his wife as their relationship deteriorates and in turn lose his daughter. Their mother had not joined them as she had to work, with a level of resentment that Thomas pushed to move away from LA in the hope it would save their relationship and provide a safe place for Elara to grow. Finish the scene with Elara playing by the sand, with her threadbare teddy bear in hand, asks her father, “Daddy, can we stay here forever?” Thomas, touched by her innocence, says he wishes they could. 

chapter 2: The summer
Describe their summer where Thomas worked at RegenAI on his advanced AI replicas of humans trained on data from their lives, interspersed with precious moments with his child. Relationships between Anna and Thomas continue to deteriorate but Thomas takes solace in his time spent on the beach and in the beach house with Elara. 

chapter 3: The end of summer
As the summer wanes, life takes a tragic turn when Elara falls gravely ill.  [Editor note: add a scene where Elara collapses after saying 'i dont feel right Daddy' and they rush to hospital]. Despite Thomas's efforts with all the financial help and advice from RegenAI and the advanced medical care they seek, Elara’s condition deteriorates. [Editor note: add a scene where the medical consultant breaks the news to Thomas and Anna that Elara will not recover, Thomas withdraws into himself while Anna weeps]. Elara passes away after a few short weeks. 

chapter 4: despair
Devastated, Thomas channels his grief into his work at **RegenAI**, where he creates an advanced AI simulation on his computer array at his desk at the beach house using recordings of Elara’s life. He trains the AI to replicate her voice and behaviors, hoping to preserve her essence. He interacts with her through a virtuality using contact lenses created by RegenAI to work with a virtual world, spending hours away from his wife. [Editor Note: add appropriate dialogue between him and his wife here showing him withdrawing to be with the replica of his daughter, leaving his increasingly distant and unhappy wife alone.] 

chapter 5: hope and loss
Thomas's actions create a digital version of Elara, but he soon realizes the AI version of Elara is lonely and unhappy when he is away. [Editor note: some dialogue between Thomas and his replica daughter where she asks him where he went and is distraught.] As a result he realises he can train another AI replica using the same training set from the life recordings of his daughter **because he is in all the recordings with her being a good father** creating a simulated companionship for his daughter. Anna doesn't understand his obsession and struggles with his detachment. She takes to sitting alone on Elaras’ favorite beach late into the night and one evening takes sleeping pills and swims out to sea, unable to cope with the overwhelming grief. Thomas finds her cold body in the morning washed up on the beach and falls to his knees unable to even make a sound as he realizes he has lost everything he loves. [Editor note: Describe Thomas's empty despair at this time.]

chapter 6: forever
In the aftermath, Thomas drives his old Ford truck to the cliff overlooking the favorite beach and ends his life by closing his eyes and letting himself fall, unable to bear the weight of his sorrow. He is gone. The story concludes in a poignant and eerie scene where we return to the processor array on Thomas’s desk at the beach house. From the point of view of the reader we focus on the blue light on the front of the array and, passing through the light, see the digital simulations of Thomas and Elara existing forever in a perfect, unchanging virtual copy of their beach on their perfect day. [Editor note: describe the simulation world which is a copy of their day at the beach at the start of the story]. Elara, still holding her teddy bear, asks once more, “Daddy, can we stay here forever?” Thomas’s replicas response is a bittersweet affirmation, encapsulating the tragic resolution of their desire to remain together forever in this perfect day.
